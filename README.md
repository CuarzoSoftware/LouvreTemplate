# Louvre Template

Documented template with many functionalities overridden to make it easy to modify.

It launches swaybg, waybar, swfbar at startup, and the xdg-desktop-portal-wlr service for screencasting through PipeWire (if available). It also implements basic server-side decorations.

**Shortcuts:**

- `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to Exit.
- `F1` to launch weston-terminal.
- `Power key` to lock the session with gtklock.

For general configurations, check `utils/Settings.h`.
