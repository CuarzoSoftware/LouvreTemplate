/* The graphic backend creates an instance of this class for each available
 * display (laptop screen, HDMI display, etc.).
 *
 * All outputs are initially uninitialized. To initialize/uninitialize an output, use
 * LCompositor::addOutput()/removeOutput(). See Compositor::initialized().
 *
 * All available outputs can be accessed through LSeat::outputs(), and only the initialized ones
 * from LCompositor::outputs().
 *
 * Outputs can also be hot-plugged, see Seat::outputPlugged()/outputUnplugged() for more details.
 *
 * When initialized, a new rendering thread is created from which the GL events are triggered.
 * OpenGL rendering must only be performed within a paintGL() event and nowhere else.
 * The rendering thread blocks until repaint() is called, which later triggers the paintGL() event.
 * Calling repaint() multiple times only unlocks the rendering thread once, so within or after a
 * paintGL() event, repaint() must be called to unlock the thread again.
 *
 * Note: When views or surfaces change, they typically call repaint() automatically on the outputs
 * where they are visible. However, there are cases where it must be called manually.
 * See LCompositor::repaintAllOutputs(), LSurface::repaintOutputs(), and LView::repaint().
